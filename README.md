# Projects
Various Data science projects:

Contains the KingmaSchool project completed in June 2018 as part of my Data Science Immersive at GA (General Assembly). It took a while to publish on a public Git. Reason being, the project had to be anonemized. Hence the code does not always have a logical secquence; I had to insert anonemized files every now and then. All necessay files should be there, with the exception of the initial file, I could not anonemize this with a reasonable timeframe. So it may be rerun from about mid-way.
