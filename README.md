# Projects
Various Data science projects:

Contains the KingmaSchool project completed in June 2018 as part of my Data Science Immersive at GA (General Assembly). It took a while to publish on a public Git reason being it had to be anonemized. Hence the code does not always have a logical secquence; I had to insert anonemized files everynow and then.
